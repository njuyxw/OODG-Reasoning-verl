# Reinforcement Learning Research Repo: Eliciting Reflection in LLMs

This repository explores methods for eliciting reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a focus on the Knights and Knaves (KK) logic puzzle dataset.  We investigate both direct RL training and a distillation-based approach for smaller models.

---

## Eliciting Reflection in LLMs with RL

We first experimented with directly applying RL to elicit reflection, building upon the work of [Logic-RL](https://github.com/Unakar/Logic-RL). We used the GRPO algorithm on the 5-person configuration of the KK dataset.  While Logic-RL employs curriculum learning across various configurations, our approach focuses primarily on the 5-person setting.

**Key Result:** Our GRPO-trained Qwen2.5-7B model achieves comparable performance to Logic-RL's REINFORCE++ trained model, demonstrating the effectiveness of GRPO in this setting.  Further training (step 420) leads to even better overall average performance.

**Aha Moment (different from R1!)**
**Highlight**
> Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.
> Let's try a different approach one more time

This highlight demonstrates the model's ability to recognize contradictions and adjust its reasoning strategy.

<summary>Complete reasoning trace</summary>

```
<think> To solve this, let's analyze each statement step by step, considering the implications based on whether the speakers are knights (who always tell the truth) or knaves (who always lie).

1. Sofia says: "Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight."
2. Scarlett says: "Sofia is a knight or Grace is a knave."
3. Mia says: "Aiden is not a knight."
4. Aiden says: "Scarlett is not a knight."
5. Grace says: "Mia is a knave and Mia is a knight."

Let's start by analyzing Grace's statement. Since Grace says "Mia is a knave and Mia is a knight," this statement is inherently contradictory. Therefore, Grace must be a knave (since a knave always lies).

Now that we know Grace is a knave, let's look at Scarlett's statement: "Sofia is a knight or Grace is a knave." Since Grace is a knave, Scarlett's statement is true, which means Scarlett must be a knight.

Next, let's consider Aiden's statement: "Scarlett is not a knight." Since we've determined that Scarlett is a knight, Aiden's statement is false, which means Aiden must be a knave.

Now we know Aiden is a knave, let's look at Sofia's statement: "Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight." Since Aiden is a knave, the statement "Aiden is a knight" is false. Therefore, for Sofia's statement to be true (and since Sofia is a knight), "Mia is a knave" must be true. This means Mia is a knave.

Finally, let's check Mia's statement: "Aiden is not a knight." Since Aiden is a knave, Mia's statement is true, which means Mia must be a knight. However, we've already determined that Mia is a knave, which creates a contradiction. This contradiction suggests that our initial assumption about Aiden being a knave might be incorrect.

Let's try a different approach by assuming Aiden is a knight. If Aiden is a knight, then his statement "Scarlett is not a knight" must be true, meaning Scarlett is a knave. If Scarlett is a knave, then her statement "Sofia is a knight or Grace is a knave" must be false. For the statement to be false, both "Sofia is a knight" and "Grace is a knave" must be false. This means Sofia is a knave and Grace is a knight.

If Sofia is a knave, then her statement "Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight" must be false. For the statement to be false, both "Mia is a knave" and "Aiden is a knight" must be false. This means Mia is a knight and Aiden is a knave, but we already assumed Aiden is a knight, which creates a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption that Aiden is a knight is incorrect.

Let's try a different approach again, assuming Sofia is a knight. If Sofia is a knight, then her statement "Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight" must be true. This means either Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight (or both).

Let's assume Aiden is a knave. If Aiden is a knave, then his statement "Scarlett is not a knight" is false, meaning Scarlett is a knight. If Scarlett is a knight, then her statement "Sofia is a knight or Grace is a knave" must be true. Since Sofia is a knight, the statement is true, which means Scarlett is a knight.

Now, let's check Mia's statement: "Aiden is not a knight." Since Aiden is a knave, Mia's statement is true, which means Mia must be a knight.

Finally, let's check Grace's statement: "Mia is a knave and Mia is a knight." Since Mia is a knight, Grace's statement is false, which means Grace must be a knave.

Now, let's check Sofia's statement again: "Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight." Since Mia is a knight and Aiden is a knave, Sofia's statement is false, which means Sofia must be a knave. However, we initially assumed Sofia is a knight, which creates a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions.

Let's try a different approach one more time, assuming Sofia is a knave. If Sofia is a knave, then her statement "Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight" is false. This means Mia is a knight and Aiden is a knave.

If Aiden is a knave, then his statement "Scarlett is not a knight" is false, meaning Scarlett is a knight. If Scarlett is a knight, then her statement "Sofia is a knight or Grace is a knave" must be true. Since Sofia is a knave, the statement is true, which means Scarlett is a knight.

Now, let's check Mia's statement: "Aiden is not a knight." Since Aiden is a knave, Mia's statement is true, which means Mia must be a knight.

Finally, let's check Grace's statement: "Mia is a knave and Mia is a knight." Since Mia is a knight, Grace's statement is false, which means Grace must be a knave.

Now, let's check Sofia's statement again: "Mia is a knave or Aiden is a knight." Since Mia is a knight and Aiden is a knave, Sofia's statement is false, which means Sofia must be a knave.

This configuration is consistent with all the statements. Therefore, the identities are:
Sofia is a knave
Scarlett is a knight
Mia is a knight
Aiden is a knave
Grace is a knave
</think>
<answer> (1) Sofia is a knave
(2) Scarlett is a knight
(3) Mia is a knight
(4) Aiden is a knave
(5) Grace is a knave 
</answer>
```

## Eliciting Reflection in small LMs with Distillation followed by RL

Direct RL training on smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-1.5B) proved challenging, often leading to model collapse.  We therefore investigated a distillation-based approach, first distilling knowledge from our larger, RL-trained Qwen2.5-7B model into the smaller Qwen2.5-1.5B model, and then applying RL to the distilled model.

**Key Result:** Distillation significantly improved the performance of the smaller model, allowing it to exhibit reflection patterns similar to the teacher model.  Furthermore, applying RL *after* distillation ("cold starting") led to performance comparable to the 7B model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this combined approach.

### Unfruitful attemp: Direct RL on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Insturct

Direct application of GRPO to Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct resulted in model collapse, with the model overfitting and generating dummy responses.

### Eliciting Reflection with Distillation for Small LMs
We distilled the trained Qwen2.5-7B-GRPO model into Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. This was done by sampling solutions from teacher model. The training was stable and the distilled model showed improved accuracy, though lower than teacher.

### Cold Starting RL on the Distilled Model
